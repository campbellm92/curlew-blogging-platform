# Curlew blogging platform

Curlew is a lightweight blogging platform that allows users to write blog posts in markdown files, which are then converted into HTML.

This repository contains the code for the Curlew website (built with Curlew, of course), currently live at https://curlew.mattdev.it/

If you're interested in using Curlew for your projects or would just like to check it out, please visit the website above.

The build repository for the project can be found on my repositories page on GitHub.
