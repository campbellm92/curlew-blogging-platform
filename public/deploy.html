      <h2>How to deploy your blog (with Heroku)</h2>
      <p>
        This brief guide will walk you through you how to host your blog/website
        with Heroku and have it direct to your domain. Bear in mind that Heroku
        is a <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">paid service</a>. There
        are
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/@alisdair_/top-heroku-alternatives-in-2024-6d6831cb6e08"
          >alternatives</a
        >, but Heroku is what I use for the moment. There is probably a decent
        amount of overlap in deploying a website with other providers, though.
