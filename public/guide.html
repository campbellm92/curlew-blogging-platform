      <h2>User guide</h2>
      <p>
        To use Curlew, you'll want to have basic familiarity with the following
        technologies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download"
            >Visual Studio Code:</a
          >
          most basically for writing the .md files for blog posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">Markdown:</a>
          for writing blog posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enough HTML to remove/change in the platform release you've
          downloaded.
        </li>
        <li>Enough CSS to change the styling if you want to.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If that doesn't sound too bad, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download the latest version: <br />
          Visit the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/campbellm92/curlew-blogging-platform/releases"
            >releases page</a
          >
          on GitHub to download the latest version of the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unzip the folder: <br />
          Unzip the folder wherever you'd like the app installed/wherever your
          working directory will be. Rename it if you want to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open the project with VS Code:
          <br />
          Open the unzipped folder in VS Code. You can do this by right clicking
          on the folder and selecting 'Open with VS Code', or simply by going to
          File > Open Folder in VSCode.
        </li>
        <li>
          Install dependencies:
          <br />
          Go to the top menu and open a new terminal (Terminal > New Terminal).
          In the terminal window that appears, run 'npm install' to install the
          necessary dependencies.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        From there, you're basically good to go. You can add posts in the
        'posts' directory with the file extension '.md'. Writing Markdown is
        pretty simple, and you can find a guide to the syntax
        <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">here</a>. You can
        also feel free to remove any HTML pages you don't want and change the
        styling in CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'd like to find out how you can deploy your blog to an actual live
        domain, visit the <a href="../deploy.html">deploy</a> page.

      <p>Happy blogging!</p>
