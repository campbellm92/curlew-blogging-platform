        This is Curlew: a simple, lightweight blogging platform. It is intended
        to be used by developers, but not necessarily exclusively.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Curlew, you write blog posts as markdown (.md) files which you save
        in the 'posts' directory. Once you've saved your work, the app takes
        care of converting it into HTML, which is what your reader sees in their
        browser. You can see an example in
        <a href="../posts.html">posts.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Why use Curlew?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It utilises a minimal aesthetic which is highly customisable.</li>
        <li>It's already optimised to look good on all devices.</li>
        <li>It's lightweight with minimal dependencies.</li>
        <li>
          It's configured for syntax highlighting for if you want to include
          code blocks in your blog posts.
        </li>
        <li>It's easy to deploy.</li>
      </ul>
